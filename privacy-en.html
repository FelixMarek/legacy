    <h2 id="section4">4. General information on data processing  </h2>

    <h3>1. Description and scope of data processing  </h3>

    <p>
		In general, we process only the personal data which you disclose to us when using one of our Services. Personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. When you register as a user on one of our websites or in one of our apps, you only have to provide a username, email address and, if applicable, a password. When registering for certain Services such as mobile apps, usernames and email addresses are not collected during registration but only later during the use of the Service. We always store the password you have chosen in hashed form, which never allows for an inference of the actual password.</p>
    <p>
        In the context of implementing a contract you have concluded with us, particularly in the context of fee-based Services you have chosen, the disclosure of further data, such as your full name, physical address, payment information may be required. It is sometimes also necessary to request further personal data for the purposes of processing your inquiries or providing you with support. InnoGames will handle this data confidentially and in compliance with the applicable data privacy provisions. As a matter of principle, InnoGames will not disclose personal data to third parties without your consent, unless there is a specific legal basis of doing so. 
	</p>
    <h3>2. Legal basis for personal data processing</h3>

    <p>
       Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, Art. 6(1)(a) of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) serves as the legal basis for personal data processing.
    </p>
    <p>
       In personal data processing required for the fulfilment of a contract of which the data subject is a party, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR serves as the legal basis. This also applies to the processing required in order to carry out pre-contractual actions. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Insofar as personal data processing is required for the fulfilment of a legal obligation which our company is subject to, Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR serves as the legal basis. 
    </p>
    <p>
       In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require personal data processing, Art. 6(1)(d) GDPR serves as the legal basis. 
    </p>
    <p>
       If processing is required to protect the legitimate interests of our company or of a third party, and if the interests, fundamental rights, and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the interests mentioned first, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR serves as the legal basis for processing. 
    </p>

    <h3>3. Deletion of data and duration of storage</h3>

    <p>
       The personal data of the data subject are deleted or anonymized as soon as the purpose of storage no longer exists. In addition, such storage may occur if this is provided for by the EU law or Member State laws to which we are subject. The deletion or anonymization of data also occurs when the storage period prescribed in the abovementioned laws lapses, unless further storage of the data is required for conclusion or fulfilment of a contract. 
    </p>

    <h3>4. Data security</h3>

    <p>
       InnoGames makes reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to your personal data as well as unauthorized use or falsification of these data and to minimize the corresponding risks. However, the provision of personal data, whether it be in person, over the phone or over the Internet, always involves risks and no technological system is completely free of the possibility of being manipulated or sabotaged.
    </p>
    <p>
       InnoGames processes the information collected from you in accordance with German and European data protection law. All employees are obliged to comply with data secrecy and data protection provisions and are instructed in this regard. Your data are transmitted in an encrypted form using the SSL method.
    </p>

    <h2 id="section5">5. Provision of our websites and mobile apps; creation of log files</h2>

    <h3>1. Description and scope of data processing</h3>

    <p>
       Each time one of our Services is accessed, our system automatically collects data from the system of the accessing computer. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When accessing a website, the following data is collected:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>		Internet protocol and IP address,</li>
        <li>		URL of the referring website from which the file was requested (if transferred),</li>
        <li>		name, version and language of the operating system and browser,</li>
        <li>		supported techniques and formats (e.g., cookies, Java)</li>
        <li>		the pages visited by you on the website,</li>
        <li>		date and time of access and type of HTML requests, </li>
        <li>		amount of transferred data, </li>
        <li>		access status (file transferred, file not found etc.), </li>
        <li>		duration and frequency of use. </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
       When accessing a mobile app, the following data is collected:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>		Internet protocol and IP address, </li>
        <li>		device type including display resolution, size, and pixel density, </li>
        <li>		name and version, and language of the operating system,</li>
        <li>		marketing identifier such as IDFA or GAID (if permission to access is granted),</li>
        <li>		store identifier such as Game Center ID or Google Play ID (if downloaded from app store).</li>
        <li>		date and time of access,</li>
        <li>		amount of transferred data,</li>
        <li>		access status (file transferred, file not found etc.), </li>
        <li>		duration and frequency of use.</li>
   
    </ul>

    <p>
       The date, time and IP address are also stored in the log files. If an error occurs during the use of our Services and we want to rectify this, we may also collect other data, e.g., Player ID and username. 
    </p>

    <h3>2. Purpose of data processing</h3>

    <p>
      To allow delivery of the Services to the computer of the user, your IP address must be stored for the duration of the session. In addition, we store your IP address and your log files to ensure the functionality of the Services, to optimize the website, to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
    </p>
    <p>
       Moreover, InnoGames reserves the right to store IP addresses and log files and to monitor compliance with our Terms of Service and Game Rules ("Breach of the Terms”). Particularly in this case, the data is used to prevent any cases of abuse or to resolve them in or outside of a court of law (“Legal Dispute”), and, on a case-by-case basis, to pass on the data for this purpose to investigative authorities. Apart from that, any other analysis of data is done in anonymous form as much as possible. After the end of this period, the IP address and log files are deleted, unless there are mandatory statutory storage requirements or specific prosecution and abuse investigation proceedings pending.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Legal basis for data processing  </h3>

    <p>
     The legal basis for this processing is legitimate interest, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Storage duration of data </h3>

    <p>
       The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to fulfil the purpose of their collection. In the case when data are collected for the purpose of making the Services available, this is the case when the respective session is over. 
    </p>
    <p>
       Log files which contain personal data are generally deleted after seven days at the latest, unless
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>	In case of error logs which allow us to fix errors in the game, the data will be deleted after 90 days; or</li>
        <li>	In case of a breach of the terms of service, the data will be stored for up 2 years, or for the entire duration of the Legal Dispute, whichever occurs later.</li>
    </ul>
     <p>
       After the end of this period, the IP address and log files are deleted, unless there are mandatory statutory storage requirements or specific prosecution is pending.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Possibility of objection and removal</h3>

    <p>
       The collection of data for the purpose of making the Services available and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. As a consequence, there is no objection possibility on the part of the user. Likewise, in case of error logs and breach of terms of service, there is no possibility of requesting the objection or the deletion of the log files. This decision is based on Art. 21(1) and 17(3)(f) GDPR. 
    </p>
    <h3>6. Existence of automated decision making</h3>
    <p>
   		InnoGames uses an automated tool to determine whether you are breaching our Terms of Services or Game Rules in regards of the usage of prohibited bots and scripts (“Bot Detection Tool”). The Bot Detection Tool serves us by analyzing the data produced by your hardware when playing our games. In case the Bot Detection Tool determines that your actions in the game are incompatible with the action produced by a human, you might be subject to receiving an automatic ban.
	</p>
    
    <h2 id="section6">6. Inquiries via contact form, email, support tool; legal matters</h2>

    <h3>1. Description and scope of data processing</h3>
    <p>
    	In case we receive a direct inquiry from you either via contact from, e-mail or the Support tool, we need to process your data to respond to your request. In case your request requires the involvement of the legal department your data will be processed by them as well. In the same way. the legal department might need to process your data in case you are involved in a legal matter, or dispute.  
    </p>

    <h4>a) Email</h4>

    <p>
       Alternatively, it is possible to contact us via our provided email addresses. In this case, the personal data of the user transmitted with the email is stored. 
    </p>

    <h3>2. Purpose of data processing</h3>

    <p>
       The processing of personal data serves us to process the contact and the support request by the responsible departments.
    </p>
    <p>
    	In case your contact relates to a legal matter, or a dispute between you and InnoGames, and this matter or dispute requires the attention of the legal department, the processing of your data will serve the purpose of handling legal matters or disputes, fulfilling legal obligations, complying with regulatory requirements, and to support the business units in obtaining and interpreting court orders and judgments, including accompanying and negotiating disputes.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The other personal data processed during the submission process serves to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Legal basis for data processing</h3>
    <p>
        The legal basis for this data processing is legitimate interest, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	The legal basis for the processing with the purpose of concluding a contract or serving the contract execution is performance of a contract, Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR.
	</p>
    <p>
    	The legal basis for the processing with the purpose of fulfilling legal obligations and/or complying with regulatory requirements, is performance of a legal obligation Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
    	The legal basis for the processing with the purpose of establishing, defending, or exercising legal claims is legitimate interest, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.
    </p>    
    
    <h3>4. Storage duration of data</h3>
    <p>
       The data are deleted as soon as they are no longer necessary to fulfil the purpose of their collection. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The retention duration of data used for managing legal matters or disputes is determined either by the applicable limitation period, or by the relevant legal obligations to preserve records, such as Section 147 German Fiscal Code (Abgabenordnung) and Section 257 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch). In cases where the same data is also used for another purpose outlined in this Privacy Notice, the retention period related to that purpose also applies.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Possibility of objection and removal</h3>
    <p>
       At any time after contacting us, you have the option to object to personal data processing, regardless of whether this was done via a contact form, email or support tool. In such a case, the conversation cannot continue, and your concern may not be conclusively handled. If you wish to delete all personal data stored in the course of contacting us, you have the possibility to delete your account yourself at:  <a href="https://goodbye.innogames.com/login" target="_blank"> https://goodbye.innogames.com/login </a>. Moreover, we will automatically delete your account if you have not logged in to a game or game forum in three years. This shall not apply if mandatory statutory retention requirements are applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Note, however, that there may be certain situations in which the continuous processing of your data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims, and so your right to object and request erasure will preclude, as per the Art. 17(3)(e), and Art. 21(1) GDPR.
    </p>

    <h2  id="section9">9. Use of cookies</h2>

    <h3>1. Description and scope of data processing</h3>

    <p>
		In order to ensure that you receive the most relevant information and the best service when you visit one of our websites, data will be collected through the use of cookies. It helps us (and other authorized third parties) to provide you with a personalized experience when you visit our website, and it also allows us to improve our service and ensure that you will easily find what you want. </p>
    <p>
		Cookies are small pieces of data (text files) that are sent to your browser from a web server and stored on your device so that the website can recognize your device. There are two types of cookies, permanent (or “persistent”) and temporary (or “session”) cookies. Permanent cookies are stored as a file on your computer or mobile device for a longer period of time. Session cookies are temporarily placed on your computer when you visit our website but are erased when you close the browser. If you do not want to accept cookies, you can adjust the settings in your web browsers security preferences, see more information on this below.  </p>
    <p>
    	We and our service providers may use the following categories of cookies:
    </p>

    <h4>a) Essential Cookies</h4>

    <p>
       These cookies are strictly necessary for us to provide our Services. For example, we may use these cookies to authenticate and identify our members when they use our Site so we can provide our Services. Without these cookies we would not be able to recognize you and you would not be able to access our Services. They also help us to enforce our Terms and Conditions and maintain the security of our Services.
    </p>

    <h4>b) Functionality Cookies</h4>

    <p>
     These cookies are not strictly necessary but allow us to personalize your online experience of our website. For example, they allow us to remember your preferences and mean that you do not need to re-enter information you have already provided e.g., when signing-up to our Services. We also use these cookies to collect information (e.g., popular pages, viewing patterns, click-throughs) about our visitors' usage of our Services so that we can improve our services and conduct market research. If you choose to delete these cookies, you will have limited functionality of our Services.

    <h4>c) Advertising Cookies</h4>

    <p>
		These cookies use information about your usage of our websites, e.g., the pages you visit or your response to ads, to deliver ads that are more tailored to you, both on and off our website. These types of ads are called “interest-based advertising.” Many of these types of cookies belong to our service providers. For third party advertisers, see more below.   </p>

    <h3>2. Purpose of data processing</h3>

    <p>
        We use the information from cookies to make our website user-friendly and enable us to provide you with personalization features (first-party cookies). We may also pass on information from cookies to several authorized third parties to deliver services they provide on their website (third-party cookies). 
    </p>

        <li> 	To ensure that you do not get asked to fill in survey forms repeatedly.</li>
    </ul>
    
     <p>
    	We (and our authorized third parties) may use non-personal information from both permanent cookies and session cookies for statistical purposes as follows: 
    </p>
    
     <ul>

        <li> 	To track product success.</li>
        <li> 	To determine how frequently you and other users visit our Services and your interaction in our games.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    	We set and read our own cookies to provide the following functions (first-party cookies):
    </p>
    
    <h4>a) Remember Me Cookie</h4>

    <p>
       To provide you with ‘remember me’ functionality: We allow users to log into the game via this cookie. This can be disabled by deselecting “Remember Me” on manual login.

   <h2 id="section18">18. Use of third-party video advertising services</h2>

    <h3>1. Description and scope of processing</h3>
    <p>
		Since our games are generally free to download and play, to be able to maintain and continuously develop our games we monetize them by displaying ads in them. When displaying ads, we use third-party advertising companies to serve the ads in our games. The advertising companies pay us for displaying their ads and this what makes it possible for us to offer you the game free of charge. Apart from this, we might also give you the possibility to watch an ad instead of paying for a feature that you otherwise would have to pay. The third-party advertising companies may collect and use some of your personal information, including but not limited to IP address, geo location, and language settings to offer you personalized ads, but also to know if you clicked on and watched the video ad. Non-personally identifiable information to manage and measure the delivery of advertising within that game can be collected, including the number of times the same advertisement is served and viewed.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Purpose of data processing</h3>
    <p>
    	The data is processed by us to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. We offer our mobile games for free, so these ads allow us to continue making and updating top quality free games which is a legitimate interest of ours but also of yours if you want to play games for free. Without displaying ads, we would not make sufficient money to keep offering the games for free to you. Please do not play our games if you do not wish to have your personal data processed for advertising purposes.
    </p>
    <h3>3. Legal basis for data processing</h3>
   	<h4>a) iOS and browser</h4>
    <p>
    	Personalized Ads: The legal basis for processing your personal data (especially your IDFA) for personalized ads on iOS is your consent, Art. 6(1)(a)GDPR, which you grant us by allowing tracking through the pop-up at the start of the game. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	You can revoke your consent with effect for the future as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
    		iOS: Select “Ask App Not to Track” in the consent pop-up at the start of the game (if you haven’t already disabled tracking in your system settings). If you want to withdraw your consent later: Open “Settings” > “Privacy & Security” > “Tracking”. On this screen you can control if and how apps can track you across other companies’ apps and websites. Additionally, open “Settings” > “Privacy” Security” > “Apple Advertising”. On this screen you can control if and how Apple shows you personalized ads.
    </p>
    <p>
    		Browser: Deselect “Allow third party browser cookies and pixels” in the Data Usage Window of the game. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Non-Personalized Ads: The legal basis for processing your personal data to display ads that are not personalized is a legitimate interest of ours, Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. We offer our games for free. To be able to keep doing this we show advertisements in our games for which the advertising companies pay us. Without this, we would have to charge a fee for you to play our games. It is a legitimate interest of ours to process your data to display ads that are not personalized to be able to keep providing you our games free of charge and so we remain able to compete with other companies on the market and create great and entertaining games that a large audience can enjoy, no matter how much money one is able to spend. This interest outweighs a potential contrary interest of yours if you do not want your data to be processed to display ads. Unfortunately, it is technically not possible to efficiently display ads without processing some of your personal data for this purpose. Please do not play our games if you do not wish to have your personal data processed for us to display non-personalized ads.

    <h4>b) Android and Fire OS</h4>

In case of non-personalized ads, our legitimate interest to process data to display such ads (see above) outweighs a potential contrary interest of yours.
